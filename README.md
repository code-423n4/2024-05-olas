# Overview

This audit is focused on smart contracts related to Olas staking mechanism. Olas on-chain protocol can be divided in three main parts: governance, registries, and tokenomics. Here is an overview of these parts. 

The **governance** is designed to assume various control points to steer the Olas protocol. The governance token, veOLAS is the virtualized representation of OLAS locked and used a similar approach to [veCRV](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-vecrv.html), where votes are weighted depending on the time OLAS is locked other than the amount of locked OLAS.

The VoteWeighting contract enables Olas DAO members (via veOLAS) to vote on staking programs, assigning weights according to their preferences. It adopts a model similar to the [Curve Gauge Controller](https://curve.readthedocs.io/dao-gauges.html#dao-gauges-controller), maintains a list of gauges and their associated weights.  Modifications from the original Curve Gauge Controller include granting anyone the ability to add staking contracts by removing ownership control on this functionality, and eliminating additional categorization by contract type. For more details on VotingWeight, see [Olas staking smart contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-olas/blob/main/governance/docs/StakingSmartContracts.pdf) and [Olas staking whitepaper](https://staking.olas.network/poaa-whitepaper.pdf).

The list of the governance contracts in scope for the current audit can be found in the Scope section below.

**Registries** allow developer of code in form of agents, components, or services to register and manage their code on-chain. The code existing off-chain will be uniquely represented on-chain by means of NFTs. A summary of registries is provided [here](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-olas/blob/main/registries/docs/AgentServicesFunctionality.pdf). The registry contracts related to [Olas staking](https://staking.olas.network/poaa-whitepaper.pdf) collectively form a robust system for managing staking services within an Olas ecosystem. The StakingFactory serves as a gateway for deploying staking contracts, offering flexibility through customizable verification logic. Staking contracts, designed for compatibility, provide standardized functionalities while allowing variation in activity checks tailored to specific use cases. The StakingActivityCheck contract optimistically ensures that stakers meet predefined activity criteria, contributing to the fair distribution of rewards (see [Olas staking smart contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-olas/blob/main/governance/docs/StakingSmartContracts.pdf) for more details).

The list of the registries contracts in scope for the current audit can be found in the Scope section below.

The **tokenomics** provides the following pimitives: Staking, developer rewards, and bonding (cf. [Olas tokenomics paper](https://www.autonolas.network/documents/whitepaper/Autonolas_Tokenomics_Core_Technical_Document.pdf) and [Olas staking whitepaper](https://staking.olas.network/poaa-whitepaper.pdf) for more details). 

Tokenomics contracts related to [Olas staking](https://staking.olas.network/poaa-whitepaper.pdf) introduce a robust and decentralized framework for allocating OLAS emissions to staking programs beyond the boundaries of Ethereum to
various networks such as Gnosis, Polygon, Arbitrum, Solana, and more. More details can be found in [Olas staking smart contracts](https://github.com/code-423n4/2024-05-olas/blob/main/governance/docs/StakingSmartContracts.pdf).

# Additional context

## Main invariants

Here some examples.

1. Only DAO members can cast their vote on votingWeigh 
2. Only executed DAO vote allow to sync information form L1 to L2 and vice-versa
3. In the contract in scope, only dispenser contracts has the manager rights to mint OLAS via Treasury
4. OLAS token transfer can happen only from L1 to L2 



## Attack ideas (where to focus for bugs)
Here some examples.
1. Issues arising from cross-chain interactions
2. Issues arising from incorrect tokenomics calculation
3. Minting that exceeds the global inflation curve
4. Attack to distribute more rewards than expected
5. Issues arising from ability to abuse staking factory contracts



## All trusted roles in the protocol

- DAO members decisions are always assumed to be honest
- DAO executed vote are always assumed to be honest

## Describe any novel or unique curve logic or mathematical models implemented in the contracts:

Olas staking is a novel staking mechanism that can spawn desirable autonomous AI agent economies in crypto and beyond. The smart contracts in scope of this audit are essential to enable Olas staking. Details on Olas staking can be found in https://staking.olas.network/poaa-whitepaper.pdf. 

A brief overview of the tokenomics model can be found here https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-tokenomics/blob/pre-c4a/docs/Autonolas_tokenomics_audit.pdf. For more details, see the tokenomics paper  https://www.autonolas.network/documents/whitepaper/Autonolas_Tokenomics_Core_Technical_Document.pdf. Details on

## Running tests

## 
This repository will follows the standard [`Hardhat`](https://hardhat.org/tutorial/) development process.
- The code is written on Solidity starting from version `0.8.15`.
- The standard versions of Node.js along with Yarn are required to proceed further (confirmed to work with Yarn `1.22.19` and npm `10.1.0` and node `v18.6.0`);
- [`Foundry`](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) is required to run the foundry tests.

### Install the dependencies
Each relevant directory has the `package.json` file managing dependencies, and the setup parameters are stored in the corresponding `hardhat.config.js` file.
Simply run the following command to install each of the projects (`cd governance / registries / tokenomics`):
```
yarn install
```

### Core components
The contracts, deploy scripts, regular scripts and tests are located in the following folders respectively:
```
contracts
scripts
test
```

### Compile the code and run
#### Governance
```
cd governance
```
Compile the code:
```
npx hardhat compile
```
Run tests with Hardhat:
```
npx hardhat test
```

#### Registries
```
cd registries
```
Compile the code:
```
npx hardhat compile
```
Run tests with Hardhat:
```
npx hardhat test
```
Run tests with Foundry:
```
forge test --hh -vv
```

#### Tokenomics
```
cd tokenomics
```
Compile the code:
```
npm run compile
```
Run tests with Hardhat:
```
npx hardhat test
```
Run tests with Foundry:
```
forge test --hh -vv
```

#### Foundry testing
> [!NOTE]
> Forge tests don't run by default! 

 For them to run in the corresponding folder (registries / tokenomics) one needs to go in the folder and initialize an empty
 git repo with the `git init` command, i.e. for registries:
```sh
cd registries
git init
forge test --hh -vvv
```

Run tests coverage for each of the corresponding folder (governance / registries / tokenomics)
```
npx hardhat coverage
```
