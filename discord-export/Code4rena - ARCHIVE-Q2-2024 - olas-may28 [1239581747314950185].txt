everyone able to clone successfully?


[05/29/2024 03:35] saifgaber
the naming of the folder aux is causing this issue, renaming it should solve it.

Hi all, anyone else having issues when trying to run `npx hardhat compile` in the `tokenomics` project? I'm on Mac M1 and experiencing the following error:
`Error HH404: File solmate/tokens/ERC20.sol, imported from lib/zuniswapv2/src/ZuniswapV2Pair.sol, not found.`

The other 2 projects are fine - compilation and tests run without any trouble.


[05/29/2024 08:27] pfapostol
try running `yarn install` first


[05/29/2024 08:28] _givn
Already did that, also tried installing solmate in `tokenomics`. Both didn't work.


[05/29/2024 08:28] kupermind
As per instructions scpecifically for tokenomics you compile with:
`npm run compile`

Thanks man, you correctly pointed it out. I thought it was an issue with the files in the folder. I just forked the codebase and deleted the aux folder and then it cloned successfully. Thanks again!

Hey @kupermind can you tell me what non-evm chain you are deploying contracts to?


[05/31/2024 13:24] 0xshaheen
From the docs/Readme, it looks like only Solana is the non-evm chain olas supports rn 

> Chains the protocol will be deployed on:
> Ethereum, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, Polygon, OtherGnosis, Celo, Solana

Let me see if I understand correctly the Staking contract lifecycle:
1. Anyone can create a staking contract via `StakingFactory`, as long as its configured within certain bounds.
2. Services can be staked, allowing owners to claim rewards
3. Services can be unstaked by their respective owners.

Is this more or less the gist of it?


[05/31/2024 14:40] kupermind
That's correct. In order to earn rewards, services must achieve certain activity KPIs.

[06/01/2024 15:11] saifgaber
Yes.


[06/01/2024 15:36] 0xshaheen
Every In-scope contract will be deployed on all L1s & L2s. Correct?

What is the purpose of retainer ? Since, it is just like any other nominee address, who votes for it and why ?


[06/01/2024 16:06] kupermind
It's the mans to slash the inflation - to get it back to staking, either because the user thinks there are no interesting staking contracts, or because they think the allocation for staking is too much, thus defer it


[06/01/2024 16:06] kupermind
Look into the `retain()` function - all of its accumulated amount is returned back to the tokenomics
